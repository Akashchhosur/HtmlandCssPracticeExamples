       Something has gone wrong, causing the image not to display. If the src attribute does not contain a valid path to an image, 
       the alt text will be displayed instead:The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. 
       In this example, our current text of "My test image" is not good because it doesn't convey descriptive information about the image.  
        <br> <br> A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be <u><b>The Firefox logo:</b></u> a flaming fox surrounding the Earth</p> <br>
